# RoboBotV1
This is an initial development of an Arduino Robot that follows a hand in One Dimension

This is a initial setup of a Arduino Robot being designed to follow a hand. This robot is code-named Ghettobot, as it
is being held together by zip-ties and superglue!

This robot in the final stages will have a full build tutorial posted to YouTube.

An in-depth Coding logic video will be made along side as well.
